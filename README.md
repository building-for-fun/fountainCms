# <img src="assets/logo.png" alt="FountainCMS Logo" width="48" height="48" style="vertical-align:middle;"> FountainCMS Monorepo

**FountainCMS** is a **headless, data-first Content Management System** designed to manage structured content, datasets, and metadata in a clean, scalable, and developer-friendly way.

This repository is organized as a **monorepo** containing both the **frontend (React)** and **backend (NestJS)** codebases that together power the FountainCMS ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 What is FountainCMS?

FountainCMS focuses on **explicit content modeling and API-first delivery**.

Instead of tightly coupling content with presentation, it treats content as **structured data**, allowing teams to:

- Define clear schemas for content and datasets
- Validate and manage data centrally
- Serve content securely through APIs
- Power multiple frontends from a single backend

It is built for teams that care about **data quality, strong contracts, and long-term maintainability**.

---

## 🎯 Why FountainCMS?

Most CMS platforms are either:

- Too rigid for real-world, evolving data models
- Too abstract, hiding important data decisions behind UI layers

FountainCMS solves this by:

- Making schemas **explicit and versionable**
- Encouraging **clean separation of concerns**
- Prioritizing **developer control and predictability**

This makes it especially useful for **data-heavy products, dashboards, internal tools, and modern web applications**.

---

## 👥 Who is this for?

- Developers who want full control over content modeling
- Backend-first or API-driven teams
- Startups looking for a flexible, open CMS
- Teams managing datasets, metadata, or configuration-heavy content

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (**v22.13.1** required, see `.nvmrc`)
- npm (v7+ recommended for workspaces)

### Install dependencies

At the root of the repository:

```sh
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both frontend and backend using npm workspaces.

### 🗄 Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
#### Create DB User & Database

Open psql as postgres superuser:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```sh
CREATE USER fountain_user WITH PASSWORD 'fountain_pass';
CREATE DATABASE fountain_db OWNER fountain_user;
ALTER USER fountain_user CREATEDB; -- required for Prisma migrate dev
\q
```

### 🔐 Frontend Environment Configuration
#### Create frontend .env:

```sh
cd frontend
nano .env
```
Copy the details from `.env.sample` to `.env` and save

### 🔐 Backend Environment Configuration
#### Create backend .env:
```sh
cd backend
nano .env
```
Copy the details from `.env.sample` to `.env` and save

### 🧬 Run Prisma Migrations
```sh
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will:
- Create DB tables
- Generate Prisma Client
- Sync schema

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Run frontend + backend together

```sh
npm run dev
```

Starts both services in parallel using `concurrently`.

### Run Frontend only

```sh
npm run dev:frontend
```

### Run Backend only

```sh
npm run dev:backend
```

---

## 📚 API Documentation (Swagger)

Once the backend is running:

```
http://localhost:4000/api-docs
```

---

## 🧪 Linting, Formatting, and Testing

- Linting and formatting are enforced via **Husky** and **lint-staged**
- Run all tests:

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- Pre-commit hooks will block commits if checks fail

---

## 📝 Git Commit Message Template

This project follows **Conventional Commits**.

### Enable commit template locally

```sh
git config --local commit.template .gitmessage
```

---

## 📦 Release Management & Changelog
